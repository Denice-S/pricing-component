# This is a challenge from Frontend Mentor to build out a pricing component that is responsive.

 The original challenge can be found here[frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-pricing-component-t0m8PIyY8)

The pricing component has the following features:

Different page view ranges and the corresponding monthly price totals:

- 10K pageviews / $8 per month
- 50K pageviews / $12 per month
- 100K pageviews / $16 per month
- 500k pageviews / $24 per month
- 1M pageviews / $36 per month

If the visitor switches the toggle to yearly billing, a 25% discount should be applied to all prices.
